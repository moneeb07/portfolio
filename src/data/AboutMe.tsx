      <p>
        I'm a Full Stack and AI Engineer with 1 year of experience building modern web applications
        and AI-powered systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a fast learner who adapts quickly to new technologies and applies them in real-world projects.
         I focus on strong fundamentals, clean architecture, and continuous improvement while building practical 
         solutions. I don’t claim expertise without proper understanding — when I say I know a technology, it means I’ve
          worked with it deeply and can apply it confidently. If you want to build a website for your business or automate
           your daily tasks using AI, feel free to reach out.
